        "description": "<p>Canada International (RCI) editors have corrected their reporting which falsely asserted that Tel Aviv is the capital of Israel. As we noted in our alert, RCI&rsquo;s reporting deligitimized Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radio-Canada&rsquo;s report now features the following correction notice on its website, as well, the RCI Youtube video report has been revised and republished:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note to our audience: The previous version of the text included in the video referred to the state of Israel as &ldquo;Tel Aviv&rdquo;. We changed it to &ldquo;Israeli government&rdquo; to avoid confusion as to the city&rsquo;s status and to be more precise.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Radio-Canada couldn&rsquo;t bring itself to acknowledge that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, at least these corrective measures were executed. We thank Radio-Canada for its cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"gtx-trans\" style=\"left:-172px; position:absolute; top:-6px\">\r\n<div class=\"gtx-trans-icon\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>",
